.JS most used to write logic instead of markup. 
.a Variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value. 
.declare a variable with 'let'. (let hello;)
.initialization : assigning a value to a variable at the moment of declaration. 

.JS has 7 primitive data types
.strings are immutable. 
.default value of an uninitialized variable = undefined.

.an array is a non-primitive data type. 
.non-primitive data types can hold more complex data. 
.primitive data types can only hold 1 value at a time. 
.you can access the values inside an array using the index of the value; starting from 0. 

.when a method returns a value, you can think of it as giving the value back to you, making it available for use in other parts of your code. 
.an important thing to know about the return keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your function, it also stops the execution of your code inside a function or a block statement. This means any code after a return statement will not run.
